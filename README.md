# Web Development Mid Test Project

This repository contains the frontend implementation of two web layouts developed as part of my **University Web Development course (Mid Test)**.  
Both layouts are **fully responsive** and built using only **HTML and CSS** (no external templates or frameworks used).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3 (Flexbox + Media Queries)**  

## 🎯 Purpose
This project was built **for academic evaluation** (Web Development course mid-term test).  
The goal was to demonstrate **layout design, responsiveness, and styling techniques** without relying on external frameworks or templates.
